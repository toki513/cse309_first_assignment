            <p>This course serves as a comprehensive overview of web technologies and their usage. Essential topics such
                as OSI & TCP/IP architecture, Internet Routing, IP addressing & Domain Name System will be covered.
                Discussions will be held on popular browsers, HTML and Cascading Style Sheet, HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, Client
                and Server side scripts, Scripting (JavaScript, AJAX, XML) with jQuery libraries, Web Servers (IIS,
                Apache). Students will learn to design dynamic websites using ASP.NET with SQL server and PHP with My
                SQL. A brief overview of topics in web security such as cryptography, digital signatures, digital
                certificates, authentication & firewall will be provided.</p>
